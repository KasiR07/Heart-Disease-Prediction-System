# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System

This repository contains a **Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System** built using Python. It analyzes patient health parameters to predict the likelihood of heart disease. The system uses supervised learning algorithms and focuses on improving diagnostic support for early detection.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease based on medical attributes such as cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, chest pain type, and more. It serves as a decision-support system for healthcare providers.
